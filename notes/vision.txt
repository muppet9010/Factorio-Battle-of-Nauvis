High Level Gameplay
===================

- A simultanious execution minatures war game with all players doing concurrent secret turn planning.
- A turn is made up of 3 actions, with each action having 3 action points within it. Players design their turn on a per action basis, with action points used within an action to track real time activities. Actions & action points are a continous time stream, with turns being the command and control cycle.
- A game will be a set number of actions.
- The winner of a game will be based on the game objective: securing intellignce on the map, domination, annilation of enemy. kill value to be used in a draw.
- Players fight on a relatively open city based area.
- The map will be fully revelaed. There will be options for fog of war of: none, enemy plips (not unit type) and full visibility.
- Players have a force made up of squads of the same unit type. A force will be a few squads or more (10+ units).
- Initial unit types: tank, AA vehicle, infantry, infantry transport, vehicle carrying helicopter.
- Units complete movement physically and so can block each others execution.
- Orders are given to individual units and not per squad. This allows for engagement flexibility.
- Units are ordered to spend their actions in any combination:
    - move (full movement speed per action).
    - shoot while moving (variable reduction of movement) - 1 action point delay to target acquisition starting.
    - shoot while stationary.
    - hold per action point, to allow for choreographed movement.
- Squads set to shoot will have to spend 1 action point post target visibility in target acquisition.
- Squads can be set to overwatch shooting (shoot automatically) will by default shoot a valid target unit based on priority order. They will not overkill the same target unit and will have a 1 action point delay where required to avoid this.
- Squads can be set to targeted shooting where ordered to shoot at a specific squad if desired during planning. This will bypass priority targeting, but will still avoid overkilling the targeted squad units.
- All units will take 2 complete actions to reload and update anti-countermeasures before they are ready for their next shooting action to be done. 1 shot per 3 actions.
- Units in a squad must be kept within a close range of each other to maintain cohesion - not sure how to enforce this given movement may be blocked. Maybe any unit out of cohesion can't fire as it can't get target confirmation? How to handle only 2 units if they split, which one is lead? Also need to allow for units trying to move into cohesion but being prevented via other units from the real time runtime aspect.


Possible Variations
============

- Possibly executed as 1 battle group for all players simultaniously, rather than as all forces for all players. If needed for balance or to make gameplay cleaner for players.
- The number of actions per turn is configurable and just represents the command and control delay.



High level Functional Aspects
=====================

- Use game units and pathfinding to navigate between points. Players will need to manage the staggering and ordering of units through tight spaces, etc, with the use of delay.
- Shooting will be done via script choosing the targets on priority list.




Functionality
============

Commanding Units
---------------

- Some sort of cursor tool to allow selection of single units by left clicking on a unit.
- Once unit is selected right click to open the order GUI for this unit.
- Order GUI will have the options for the unit.
- If move is involved in order then a highlight of the possible movement spots will be shown.
- If shoot/overwatch is selected then a highlight of the range and vision from the spot will be shown.
- Need to allow chaining togeatehr orders and adding new ones, removing orders via the GUI.

Units
-------------

- Vehicle type units will be type "car" so I can have gun turrets on them.
- Infantry type units will be something?????
- Movement of vehicle units will be done via script setting direction and speed as can't use pathfinder or automatic movement for car type.
- Shooting of units will be done via script for target acquisition and for generatign hit chance, etc. Shooting will be an effect on a pre-generated outcome.




Excluded Functionality
==============

Commanding Units
---------------

- Ability to select more than 1 unit at a time.

Moving Units
-------------





Future Ideas
===========

Second wave
---------

You get up to half your points deployed at game start and the other half a few turns later. Game is slightly longer than normal. To add some greater tactical variation at the start of the game, vs a fuller balance late game.
